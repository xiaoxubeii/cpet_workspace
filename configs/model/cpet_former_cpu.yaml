# CPETFormer CPU-friendly configuration
#
# This variant mirrors the default cpet_former.yaml but forces training on CPU,
# which is useful for smoke tests on environments without CUDA support.

# Force CPU execution for environments without CUDA

# Disable LR scheduler during CPU-only evaluation to avoid checkpoint mismatch
